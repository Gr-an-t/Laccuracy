# Laccuracy
Laccuracy, lack of accuracy, is a simple plugin that adds adjustable inaccuracy to skeletons, with more projectiles and mobs planned.

## Commands
* `/setaccuracy <mob> <value>` Sets the accuracy modifier for the target mob
* `/getaccuracy <mob>` Gets the current accuracy modifier for the target mob

## Configuration
You can set the accuracy modifier in the `confg.yml` file by adjusting this line:
```
accuracy:
  skeleton: 0.2
```
The config file can be updated in game using the `/setaccuracy` command.
