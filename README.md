# Laccuracy  
Laccuracy, lack of accuracy, is a simple plugin that adds adjustable inaccuracy to mobs and projectiles. 

## Commands
* `/setaccuracy <mob> <value>` Sets the accuracy modifier for the target mob
* `/getaccuracy <mob>` Gets the current accuracy modifier for the target mob

## Configuration
You can set the accuracy modifier in the `confg.yml` file by adjusting this line:
```
accuracy:
  skeleton: 0.2
  ghast: 0.2
  pillager: 0.2
  blaze: 0.2
  drowned: 0.2
  bogged: 0.2
  piglin: 0.2
  stray: 0.2
  witch: 0.2
  wither_skeleton: 0.2
  end_dragon: 0.2
  breeze: 0.2
```
The config file can be updated in game using the `/setaccuracy` command.
